/**
 * Runs an array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next
 * in the array. However, if any of the functions pass an error to the callback,
 * the next function is not executed and the main callback is immediately called
 * with the error.
 *
 * @param tasks An array of functions to run, each function is passed a callback(err, result1, result2, ...) it must call on completion. The first argument is an error (which can be null) and any further arguments will be passed as arguments in order to the next task.
 * @param callback An optional callback to run once all the functions have completed. This will be passed the results of the last task's callback.
 * @param forceAsync An optional flag that force tasks run asynchronously even if they are sync.
